## Lab Sheet 3 — Simulation of File Allocation, Memory Management, and CPU Scheduling

### Objective
To simulate and analyze operating system components such as memory management techniques, CPU scheduling policies, and file allocation strategies. This lab focuses on implementing theoretical OS concepts in Python to understand how these mechanisms work internally.

### Tasks

#### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- Priority Scheduling  
- Round Robin Scheduling  
- Shortest Job First (SJF)  
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)

#### File Allocation Methods
- Sequential File Allocation  
- Indexed File Allocation  

#### Memory Allocation Algorithms
- First-Fit  
- Best-Fit  
- Worst-Fit  

#### Memory Management Techniques
- MFT (Multiprogramming with Fixed Tasks)  
- MVT (Multiprogramming with Variable Tasks)

### Conclusion
Lab Sheet 3 reinforces core OS concepts by simulating file allocation, memory management, and scheduling algorithms. These programs transform theoretical mechanisms into executable Python simulations, deepening practical understanding.
